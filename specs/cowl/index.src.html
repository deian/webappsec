Abstract:
  This specification defines an API for specifying privacy and
  integrity policies on data, in the form of origin labels, and a
  mechanism for confining code according to such policies.  This
  allows Web application authors and server operators to shared data
  with untrusted&mdash;buggy but not malicious&mdash;code (e.g., in a mashup
  scenario) yet impose restrictions on how the code can share the data
  further.
     
  In addition, this specification defines a light-weight, in-thread
  Worker.  Combined with confinement, this allows developers to build
  privilege-separated, compartmentalized applications.

  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Sites and applications on the web are conglomerations of JavaScript
  written by multiple authors. Authors routinely incorporate
  third-party scripts into their applications and share user data with
  third-party services (e.g., as part of a <em>mashup</em>).
  Unfortunately, in the existing model, authors put the user's
  data confidentiality and integrity at risk when incorporating
  untrusted third-party code or sharing data with untrusted
  third-party services.

  Mechanisms such as CORS and CSP can be used to mitigate these risks
  by giving authors control over whom they share data with. But, once
  data is shared, these mechanisms do not impose any restrictions on
  how the code that was "granted access" can further disseminate the
  data.

  This document specifies an extension to the current model,
  Confinement with Origin Web Labels (COWL), which allows authors to
  specify access control policies on data (including content) in terms
  of origin <a>labels</a>.  These policies are enforced in a mandatory
  fashion, transitively, even once code has access to the data.  For
  example, with COWL, the author of <code>https://example.com/</code>
  can specify that a password is confidential to
  <code>https://example.com/</code> (and thus should only be disclosed
  to <code>https://example.com/</code>) before sharing it with a
  third-party password strength checking service. In turn, COWL
  ensures that the third-party service, which necessarily computes on
  the password, is confined and respects the policy on the password,
  i.e., it cannot disclose the password to any origin other than
  <code>https://example.com/</code>.

  COWL enforces such policies by confining code, at the
  <a>context</a>-level, according to the sensitivity of the data it
  has observed. To reap the greatest benefits of COWL, authors will
  need to compartmentalized applications into multiple contexts (e.g.,
  <a>iframe</a> or <a>light-weight Workers</a>).

  COWL is intended to be used as a defense-in-depth mechanism that can
  restrict how untrusted code handles sensitive data. To prevent
  untrusted code from accessing data in the first place, authors should
  still use discretionary access control mechanisms, such as CSP and
  CORS.


  <section>
  <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

  The goal of COWL is to provide authors with a means for protecting
  the confidentiality and integrity of data that is shared with
  untrusted, whether third-party or their own, code.  Existing
  mechanisms (e.g., CORS and the <a>postMessage()</a> <a argument
    for="postMessage()">targetOrigin</a> argument) provide a way for
  restricting which origins may access (shared) data.  But, once
  content has access to data it can usually disseminate it without
  restrictions.  While CSP can be used to confine code, and thus
  restrict how confidential data is disseminated, setting a correct
  CSP policy (as to confine code) is difficult and limited to
  content the author has control over. Indeed, sharing confidential
  data (e.g., via cross-document messaging) implicitly requires the
  author to trust the receiver not to leak the data, accidentally or
  otherwise.  COWL provides a defense-in-depth option for
  protecting data confidentiality and integrity.  In particular,
  with COWL:

  1. Authors should be able to specify confidentiality and integrity
  policies on data in terms of origin labels: the origins to whom the
  data is confidential and the origins that endorse the data.  This
  allows authors to share sensitive data with third-party content and
  impose restrictions on the origins with which it can communicate
  once it inspects the sensitive data. Dually, it allows authors to
  share data via intermediate content while retaining its integrity.

  2. Authors should be able to run code with <em>least privilege</em>
  by restricting how the code can disseminate sensitive data.

  3. Authors should be able to <em>privilege separate</em>
  applications by loading untrusted scripts in separate
  <a>light-weight Workers</a> instead of inline <{script}> elements,
  which have the same privileges as content.

    <h3 id="trust-model">Trust Model</h3>
    COWL provides developers with a way of imposing restrictions on
    how untrusted code can disseminated sensitive data.  However,
    authors should not share sensitive data with malicious code, since
    such code may be able to exploit covert channels, which are present
    in most browsers, to leak the data.  COWL can only prevent
    information leakage from code that (e.g., is buggy and) exploits
    overt communication channels.

    Note, COWL should be used as an additional defense layer to other
    security mechanisms such as CSP, SRI, CORS, and iframe <code><a
    element-attr>sandbox</a></code>.
