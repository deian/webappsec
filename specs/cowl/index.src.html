Abstract:
  This specification defines an API for specifying privacy and
  integrity policies on data, in the form of origin labels, and a
  mechanism for confining code according to such policies.  This
  allows Web application authors and server operators to shared data
  with untrusted&mdash;buggy but not malicious&mdash;code (e.g., in a mashup
  scenario) yet impose restrictions on how the code can share the data
  further.
     
  In addition, this specification defines a light-weight, in-thread
  Worker.  Combined with confinement, this allows developers to build
  privilege-separated, compartmentalized applications.

<section>
  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Modern Web applications are conglomerations of JavaScript written by
  multiple authors. Authors routinely incorporate third-party scripts
  into their applications and share user data with third-party
  services (e.g., as part of a <em>mashup</em>).  Unfortunately, in
  the existing model, authors put the user's data confidentiality and
  integrity at risk when incorporating such untrusted third-party code
  or sharing data with untrusted third-party services.

  Mechanisms such as CORS and CSP can be used to mitigate these risks
  by giving authors control over whom they share data with. But, once
  data is shared, these mechanisms do not impose any restrictions on
  how the code that was "granted access" can further disseminate the
  data.

  This document specifies an extension to the current model called
  Confinement with Origin Web Labels (COWL). COWL provides authors
  with APIs for specifying access control policies on data (including
  content) in terms of <a>origin</a> <a>labels</a>.  These policies are
  enforced in a mandatory fashion, transitively, even once code has
  access to the data.  For example, with COWL, the author of
  <code>https://example.com/</code> can specify that a password is
  confidential to <code>https://example.com/</code> (and thus should
  only be disclosed to <code>https://example.com/</code>) before
  sharing it with a third-party password strength checking service. In
  turn, COWL ensures that the third-party service, which necessarily
  computes on the password, is confined and respects the policy on the
  password, i.e., it cannot disclose the password to any origin other
  than <code>https://example.com/</code>.

  COWL enforces such policies by confining code, at the
  <a>context</a>-level, according to the sensitivity of the data the
  code has observed. To reap the greatest benefits of COWL, authors
  will need to compartmentalize applications into multiple contexts
  (e.g., <a>iframe</a> or <a>light-weight Workers</a>). For example,
  untrusted libraries should be loaded in <a>light-weight Workers</a>
  instead of directly into a page.

  COWL is intended to be used as a defense-in-depth mechanism that can
  restrict how untrusted code handles sensitive data. To prevent
  untrusted code from accessing data in the first place, authors should
  still use discretionary access control mechanisms, such as CSP and
  CORS.


  <section>
  <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

  The goal of COWL is to provide authors with a means for protecting
  the confidentiality and integrity of data that is shared with
  untrusted, whether third-party or their own, code.  Existing
  mechanisms (e.g., CORS and the <a>postMessage()</a> <a argument
    for="postMessage()">targetOrigin</a> argument) provide a way for
  restricting which origins may access (shared) data.  But, once
  content has access to data it can usually disseminate it without
  restrictions.  While CSP can be used to confine code, and thus
  restrict how confidential data is disseminated, setting a correct
  CSP policy (as to confine code) is difficult and limited to
  content the author has control over. Indeed, sharing confidential
  data (e.g., via cross-document messaging) implicitly requires the
  author to trust the receiver not to leak the data, accidentally or
  otherwise.  COWL provides a defense-in-depth option for
  protecting data confidentiality and integrity.  In particular,
  with COWL:

  1. Authors should be able to specify confidentiality and integrity
  policies on data in terms of origin labels: the origins to whom the
  data is confidential and the origins that endorse the data.  This
  allows authors to share sensitive data with third-party content and
  impose restrictions on the origins with which it can communicate
  once it inspects the sensitive data. Dually, it allows authors to
  share data via intermediate content while retaining its integrity.

  2. Authors should be able to run code with <em>least privilege</em>
  by restricting how the code can disseminate sensitive data.

  3. Authors should be able to <em>privilege separate</em>
  applications by loading untrusted scripts in separate
  <a>light-weight Workers</a> instead of inline <{script}> elements,
  which have the same privileges as content.

    <h3 id="trust-model">Trust Model</h3>
    COWL provides developers with a way of imposing restrictions on
    how untrusted code can disseminate sensitive data.  However,
    authors should not share sensitive data with malicious code, since
    such code may be able to exploit covert channels, which are present
    in most browsers, to leak the data.  COWL can only prevent
    information leakage from code that (e.g., is buggy and) uses
    overt communication channels.

    Note, COWL should be used as an additional defense layer to other
    security mechanisms such as CSP, SRI, CORS, and iframe <code><a
    element-attr>sandbox</a></code>.

  <ol>
    <li>
      An <dfn>origin label</dfn>, or more succinctly a
      <dfn>label</dfn>, encodes either a confidentiality or integrity
      security policy. Labels can be associated with <a>contexts</a>
      and <a>JSON objects</a>.

      When associated with a <a>context</a>, the label restricts the
      origins that the context can communicate with, as detailed in
      [[#context-labels]].

      <div class="example">
       When associate with a context, the confidentiality label 
       <code>
          <a interface>Label</a>('https://a.com').<a>or</a>('https://b.com')
       </code>
       restricts the context to sending data to
       <code>https://a.com</code> or <code>https://b.com</code>, but
       no other origins.
       The context label reflects the fact the context may contain data
       that is sensitive to either <code>https://a.com</code> or
       <code>https://b.com</code>; it is thus only safe for it to
       communicate <em>to</em> these origins.

       Note, because the context can communicate data to either origin,
       another context associated with the more-strict
       <code><a interface>Label</a>('https://a.com')</code> label cannot
       send it data. Doing so may allow for data confidential
       to <code>https://a.com</code> to be leaked to <code>https://b.com</code>.
      </div>

      When associated with a <a>JSON object</a>, a confidentiality
      label specifies the origins to whom the object is sensitive,
      while an integrity label specifies the origins that
      endorse the object. [[#object-labels]] defines how labels are
      associated with objects.

      <div class="example">
        Suppose <code>https://example.com</code> receives a <a>JSON
        object</a> (e.g., via <a>postMessage()</a>) and has the
        following labels:
        
        * Confidentiality label: <code><a interface>Label</a>('https://example.com')</code>.
        This label indicates that the object is confidential to
        <code>https://example.com</code>.

        * Integrity label: <code><a interface>Label</a>('https://a.com')</code>.
        This label indicates that the object has been endorsed by
        <code>https://a.com</code>. If
        <code>https://example.com</code> received the message from
        <code>https://b.com</code>, the label reflects the fact that the
        object was not tampered by <code>https://b.com</code>.

      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      A label is in <dfn>normal form</dfn> if reducing it according to
      the <a>reduce to label normal form</a> algorithm produces the
      same value.
    </li>
    <li>
      Two labels are <dfn>equivalent</dfn> if their <a>normal form</a>
      values are equal.
    </li>
    <li>
      A label <var>A</var> <dfn>subsumes</dfn> another label
      <var>B</var> if the result of running the <a>subsumes check</a>
      algorithm on the <a>normal form</a>s of <var>A</var> and
      <var>B</var> returns <code>true</code>.

  <section>
    <h3 id="label">Label interface</h3>
    A <a interface>Label</a> must have an internal <dfn>label set</dfn>, which is
    a non-empty [[!ECMA-262]] <code>Set</code> of <a>disjunction set</a>s.

    A <dfn>disjunction set</dfn> is an [[!ECMA-262]]
    <code>Set</code> of <a>origin</a> <a>URL</a>s.

    A label is said to be an <dfn>empty label</dfn> if its <a>label
      set</a> contains a single, empty <a>disjunction set</a>.

    <pre class="idl">
      [Constructor, Constructor(DOMString origin)]
      interface Label {
        boolean equals(Label other);
        boolean subsumes(Label other);

        Label _or(Label other);

        object toJSON();
        [Throws] static Label fromJSON(object json);

    ISSUE: Current WebIDL implementation requires and underscore for
    certain identifiers. Can we rename <code>_or</code> to
    <code>or</code>?
